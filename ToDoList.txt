-test GPS power consumption when fix is achieved (MS) - appears to be around 30-35mA. Is that pedestrian mode? Should be switched into on/of mode?
-GPS low power mode in between fixes. 
-see if MPU9255 is by default in sleep mode or not and turn in into sleep mode if needed. Check default register values, check if there is a way to permanently set it up for sleep mode so that it doesnt use our memory.
